## [Using JS-Restrictor with Brave](#using-js-restrictor-with-brave)

JavaScript Restrictor or [JShelter](https://polcak.github.io/jsrestrictor/) extension is normally not needed with Brave Browser, however you can  use it to fine control some specific settings if you want to. Changing those options can make you more unique and is the reason why this is not suggested unless you know exactly what you are dealing with.


JShelter uses, depending on your chosen profile, [twice as much CPU power](https://github.com/polcak/jsrestrictor/issues/151) than uBlock Origin or other solutions which you can check with the integrated Task Manager and internal debugging tools. This is the main reason why I not suggest using it on a daily basis. It is better to wait until Brave addresses all above listed privacy risks.

Importing the configuration file is quickly done. Just import the configuration and click override. After that relead the website and check the configuration to ensure that settings are fully working. I includes some example pages for reference.
