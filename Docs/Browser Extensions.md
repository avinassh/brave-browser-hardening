[Canvas Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-blocker-fingerprin/nomnklagbgmgghhjidfhnoelnjfndfpd) | Brave [randomize the fingerprint, depending on your Shield settings](https://brave.com/privacy-updates-3/).
[Canvas Fingerprint Defender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-fingerprint-defend/lanfdkkpgfjfdikkncbnojekcppdebfp) | ‚Üë
[CanvasFingerprintBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvasfingerprintblock/ipmjngkmngdcdpmgmiebdmfbkcecdndc) | ‚Üë
[ChromeGalvanizer](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/ChromeGalvanizer) | Harden your browser against extension backdoors and exploits. Brave includes hardening already by default.
[Cookie-AutoDelete](https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete) | Set shield defaults to never allow Cookies and only unlock Cookies when needed, ensure "clear browser data on exit" and cookies are enabled in Brave's settings.
[Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj) | Decentraleyes is practically abandonware with little to no impact and outdated resources. The benefit cannot be proven in the real-world because CDNs update very often, due to security fixes, performance etc. using hardcoded and old libraries can make you more vulnerable.
[Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/disconnect) | Useless, integrated into Braves filter-lists.
[Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) | Brave Ad Block does the same. ‚Üë
[HTTPS Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere) | Integrated into [Brave Shields](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022973471-What-is-Shields).
[LAN-port-scan forbidder](https://github.com/garywill/LAN-port-scan-forbidder) | Browser extension to protect private network. You can archive same with a Lan blocking filterlist + Browser restricts specific ports already by default.
[LocalCDN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localcdn/njdfdhgcmkocbgbhcioffdbicglldapd) | Integrated into Brave Shields, lots of [CDNs and Endpoints getting tunneled](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-(features-we-disable-or-remove)#services-we-proxy-through-brave-servers).
[NoScript](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm) | Not needed, you archive same with Brave shield or uBlock (if you know how to work with custom filters).
[Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) | Privacy Badger does same as uBO/Brave Adblock, the ["AI" based function (learning) got disabled by default](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger/faq#How-does-Privacy-Badger-work) due to metadata (privacy) concerns. It can also easily be [detected](https://adtechmadness.wordpress.com/2020/03/27/detecting-privacy-badgers-canvas-fp-detection/).
[Privacy Possum](https://github.com/cowlicks/privacypossum) | Integrated into Brave Shields.
[Trace](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trace-online-tracking-pro/njkmjblmcfiobddjgebnoeldkjcplfjb) | Partially integrated into Shields, not all features.
