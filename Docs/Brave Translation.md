## [Brave Translation FAQ](#brave-translation-faq)
- Brave currently has no translation engine and they cannot use Googles without violating their terms of service, which results in placeholders and incompatibility with the Google Translate extension. Same goes for Voice btw.
- Official website will be `translate.brave.com`.
- The API might be the same as Vivaldi, [Lingvanex (lingvanex.com)](https://lingvanex.com/).
