## [Why does Brave consume more RAM than Chrome](#why-does-brave-consume-more-ram-than-chrome)

- Brave currently contains over 250k code changes compared to Chrome, which adds a lot of more features such as ad-blocking, Rewards, Wallet integration and more. Brave is not only yet another Chromium fork and adds a lot of unique features.
- You can reduce the overall memory footprint by disabling hardware acceleration and disable to let run Brave in the background. Both options are enabled by default. You find the options under `brave://settings/system`. Disabling Brave News also reduces the memory usage.
- The Brave Team as well as the Chrome team constantly working on lowering the overall memory footprint, however while adding more and more features and dependencies this is a challenging task.
- On some systems Brave comes preinstalled with an extension called Plasma Integration, it is enabled by default. If you do not use the GTK+ theme + search for e.g. Kwin or KRunner you can disable or uninstall it.
