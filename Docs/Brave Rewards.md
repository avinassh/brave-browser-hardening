## [Brave Rewards FAQ](#brave-rewards-faq)

- Brave Rewards, depending on your country count as income, which means it is [NOT tax free (koinly.io)](https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-airdrop-tax/).
- Claiming Rewards on Mobile [requires SafetyNet to pass (ruqqus.com)](https://ruqqus.com/+BraveBrowser/post/bk8n/android-if-your-phone-fails-safetynet) and depends on Google Play Services. If you never pass SafetyNet you will not be able to claim your BAT and you might be flagged by the system which means you will never see any ads.
- I got some BAT and cannot verify my wallet (country not supported etc.). Create a publisher's account and connect your YouTube, Reddit or a website. Then tip yourself. You'll lose 10% of your BAT in the process, but it's better than losing everything.
- If you cannot claim your reward disable your VPN/Proxy and restart (relaunch) your Browser. Keep in mind that toggling VPN, Proxies, Tor, Shadowsocks etc. might results that your account gets flagged automatically by the system, this means you do not see any ads anymore once this is done. You can ask in the forum to remove the flag from your account but if they notice you constantly toggle such systems you might even get banned. The flagging system is in place to avoid fraud and not to censor someone.
- If you format your PC/Smartphone you loose your BAT because they are temporarily stored on local machine until sync grabs it.
- If you see 0.00 BAT (while you actually have some BATs) wait, the sync might be confused, no need to panic! Waiting or restarting your Browser can help in this case.
