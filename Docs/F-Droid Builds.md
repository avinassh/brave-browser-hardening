## [Unofficial Brave Browser Build on F-Droid](#unofficial-brave-browser-build-on-f-droid)

Brave Browser is not (yet) listed in any official F-Droid repository or has their own because there are some leftovers in the Brave source code as well as some other thing that need to be addressed first. Another point is that the app uses Google Push which is by default disabled. Brave Team said that they trust the Android eco-system and this is the main reason why they implemented Googles Push solution. However, time passed by and in the meantime [reliable and more privacy friendly push solution emerged](https://medevel.com/15-os-push-notification/) which might be implemented in the near future.

However, there is an unofficial Repository - [Alefvanoon's Repository](https://repo.alefvanoon.xyz/fdroid/repo/?fingerprint=04DF198F553069C7BE60F057AE12000E99F7700DA895CC1CE2EB11DC871581F1) - which delivers Brave Browser with 2 Anti-Features, you can add the repository via QR-Code in F-Droid, Aurora Droid or enable the repository in the Droidify app.

Please keep in mind that [using F-Droid has its own downsides](https://wonderfall.dev/fdroid-issues/) and that Alefvanoon repository is usually far behind in releasing new stable builds.
