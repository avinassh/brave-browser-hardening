## [Useful Brave Browser Tips](#useful-brave-browser-tips)

- [Add shortcuts to instantly use a website's search bar directly from Brave's search bar, e.g. YouTube, Amazon, etc.](https://old.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/r7pnlk/psa_you_can_add_shortcuts_to_instantly_use_a/)
- **DO NOT** use nightly builds. The logic to use nightly builds to get "things first" is flawed. Often you run into MORE fingerprinting due to bugs and not reviewed stuff than using stable builds. Critical vulnerabilities getting fixed immediately in stable builds anyway.
- Brave is well [documented](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us) and their [Wiki](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki) helps a lot.
- ~~Export / import Chrome flags (mobile/desktop) via script, see [here](https://gist.github.com/kkeybbs/d817fad016b401485ab8c4c8fcffe568).~~
- Go to `brave://adblock` (URI also works in Mobile!) and enable following Filters only to maintain the best filtering performance: `CJX's Annoyance List`, `Easylist-Cookie List - Filter Obtrusive Cookie Notices`, `Fanboy Annoyances List`, `Fanboy Social List` (_optional_), `uBlock Annoyances List (used with Fanboy Annoyances List)` + **one OPTIONAL** language based Easylist (depends on your Region). __DO NOT__ enable more filters, more is not (always) better.
- Starting with Chrome 90/91+ [Sandboxie Technologies](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie) (SBIE Open source) has some issues with Chrome/Chromium/Brave, I do not suggest using it. If you want another isolation layer use a [RAM Disk](https://www.raymond.cc/blog/12-ram-disk-software-benchmarked-for-fastest-read-and-write-speed/) and outsource entirely all temp data into that drive. It has a much better performance than Sandboxie.
- You still can [change the User-Agent on mobile with root](https://newbedev.com/how-to-make-google-chrome-definitely-remain-as-the-desktop-version), it is not advised to change the UA because [Brave addressed all UA based concerns](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9190).
- [How-To start Brave in Incognito Mode](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/2105), see also here for a [more in-depth guidance](https://techpp.com/2020/02/07/always-launch-google-chrome-incognito-mode/).
- You can start Brave directly in _Tor Mode_ via `onion` e.g. `"C:\Program Files\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe" onion`, further modes and implementation is been discussed over [here](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/2105).
- If Brave Browser blocks your download turn off "Safe Browsing" in the settings. There is also a secret cheat code built into these warnings like "This is not a safe connection" etc. if you type in using your keyboard `thisisunsafe` in all lower case, you can [bypass any security warningst](https://cybercafe.dev/thisisunsafe-bypassing-chrome-security-warnings/).
- "Zero-copy rasterizer" and "Disable site isolation" shall be never touched, they causing crashes.
- Some useful start parameters are `--silent-launch`, `--tor` and `--incognito`, those [cmdline params](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Chromium_Command_Line_Switches.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) work since 1.29.48 (or higher).
