## [Brave Wallet FAQ](#brave-wallet-faq)

You can see the Wallet implementation progress [here](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/projects/24).

- Brave [Wallet’s source code](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/master/LICENSE) is available under an Open Source license, unlike other popular web 3.0 extensions.
- Default currency and crypto conversion display settings. (_planned_)
- Full native NFT support, including owned NFT discovery, an NFT catalog, and the addition of NFT asset values in your portfolio. (_planned_)
- If you install MetaMask, then the default wallet will actively change to MetaMask. If you’re a user of the old Crypto Wallets extension in Brave (a fork of MetaMask), then the first thing to know is that you can switch back to the old wallet in brave://settings/wallet by changing your default wallet back to Crypto Wallets.
- Live Market data for most asset (including non EVM based assets) (_planned_)
- Support for more blockchains (_planned_)
