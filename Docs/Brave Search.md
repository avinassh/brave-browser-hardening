## [Brave Search FAQ](#brave-search-faq)

Brave needs to fix mentioned points otherwise I cannot suggest using it as private alternative. Until then you could use Qwant, Presearch or other [listed alternatives (chef-koch.bearblog.dev)](https://chef-koch.bearblog.dev/privacy-tools-list-by-chef-koch/#metasearch-engines).


![Brave Premium Search](https://i.ibb.co/Lvt1tJ6/j0ail2sokac81.png)


- Brave Search removed the Beta tag in the Search Settings. The Website itself remains beta.
- [Brave Search Premium is 3$ a month (account.brave.com)](https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&product=search), Brave intends to implement Brave Rewards into Brave Search sometime in mid 2022. If you pay premium you "Get a cleaner view on all results pages", which means those that don't won't get cleaner page results.
- [Brave Search uses as fallback other search engine providers if not enough results are found](https://search.brave.com/help/independence).
- [Brave Search censorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20211202152804/https://imgur.com/a/lkPTFC1) - [original source](https://imgur.com/a/lkPTFC1) - is even worse than [Google Search censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google). Months later [Brendan Eich says that thy do not censor](https://twitter.com/brendaneich/status/1501978997860683776), It should be noted that Brave Search is still in Beta stage as time of writing this.
- [Brave Search requires you to solve a Captcha behind a VPN or Tor (imgur.com)](https://imgur.com/8RUS3Vu)
- Amazon is used as their Certificate Authority.
- Brave access your IP address upon your visit to determine your location and better serve you ads. While they claim to not store IP addresses, unlike DDG and Startpage, they do read your full IP address which is not private.
- Brave uses Amazon Cloudfront as their CDN, meaning all traffic passes through Amazon servers. CDNs itself are more than controversial. CDN usage violating GDPR according to Munich State Court, but this does not that mean [CDNs in general are not illegal (news.ycombinator.com)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30135264).
- Brave Search is currently not displaying any ads in their Beta period, but the free version of Brave Search will soon be ad-supported. Brave Search will offer an ad-free premium version in the near future, it is unclear if you can, similar like with Talk, use your Rewards to unlock the premium version or not.

- [Brave Search (brave.com)](https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/) is still beta, which means that since October 2021, Brave Search was declared the default search engine for the Brave browser users in the US, Canada, UK (replacing Google Search), France (replacing Qwant) and Germany (replacing DuckDuckGo and Ecosia).
- Starting with Brave Browser v1.26.67+ you can set the search engine to Brave Search. Since 1.34.x Brave was added officially in the list.
- You get locally based search results if you change the location settings on search.brave.com and save cookies under `brave://settings/cookies`, you must check that "Sites that can always use cookies" is selected for the website. This is a web limitation and not Braves fault, without cookies no new content can be indexed to show the actual results.
