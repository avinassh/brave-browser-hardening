- Brave Rewards, depending on your country simply counts as income, which means it is [NOT tax free (koinly.io)](https://koinly.io/blog/crypto-airdrop-tax/).
- Claiming Rewards on Mobile [requires SafetyNet to pass (ruqqus.com)](https://ruqqus.com/+BraveBrowser/post/bk8n/android-if-your-phone-fails-safetynet) and depends on Google Play Services. If you never pass SafetyNet you will not be able to claim your BAT and you might be flagged by the system which means you will never see any ads.
- I got some BAT and cannot verify my wallet (country not supported etc.). Create a publisher's account and connect your YouTube, Reddit or a website. Then tip yourself. You'll lose 10% of your BAT in the process, but it's better than losing everything.
- ~~The [previous device limit from 4 devices (community.brave.com)](https://community.brave.com/t/unable-to-re-verify-wallet/279742/118?u=chriscat) will be removed starting with Brave 1.38.x. A workaround to bypass limits seems to link your Brave Desktop to Gemini, and your phone brave browser to uphold. However this requires from you that you work with both services.~~ [Brave Rewards linking limits are going to be removed after the May payout (github.com)](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/18572#issuecomment-1104487197).
- If you format your PC/Smartphone you loose your BAT because they are temporarily stored on local machine until sync grabs it.
- If you see 0.00 BAT (while you actually have some BATs) wait, the sync might be confused, no need to panic! Waiting or restarting your Browser can help in this case.
- In case you see no Ads at all while you actually enabled it, make sure you check this [article (community.brave.com)](https://community.brave.com/t/if-you-not-receive-ads-on-windows-or-ubuntu/162298) first.
- Most Rewards settings in the Browser requires a Browser restart, Brave currently has no warning or info popup for this implemented. But if you switch for example the `Default cryptocurrency wallet` option you need to restart your Brave Browser. Most problems can be solved by just restarting the Browser.
- Rewards are borked on Arch Linux based Distros, which seems to be a [Wayland problem (github.com)](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/13352).
- The lack of Brave Rewards on iOS is thanks to Apple's App Store rules, see [here (brave.com)](https://brave.com/rewards-ios/) why.
- Verifying your (Uphold/Gemini) Wallet requires minimum 15 BAT (_reduced from previously 25_).
- You can change the ads window position, just click and hold on the window while it appears and then you can drag it to another position.
- You can obtain growth statistics for BAT [here (basicattentiontoken.org)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/growth), monthly [growth statistics are disclosed here (bravebat.info)](https://bravebat.info/).

- [Custom tipping amount (reddit.com)](https://old.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/nn73yz/custom_tipping_amounts_feature_is_now_live_on/) can freely adjusted (_for now_) on Desktop only.

- [No more 5 BAT payout minimum for Creators (ruqqus.com)](https://ruqqus.com/+BraveBrowser/post/c5wk/no-more-5-bat-payout-minimum).
- [The browser Brave pays its 42 million users 70% of the revenue it generates from ads they see. Brave compensates them in its own “Basic Attention Tokens,” which they can redeem for currency or use to tip their favorite sites. Users report earning $5 to $10 monthly, according to a Brave spokeswoman (wsj.com)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/personal-data-is-worth-billions-these-startups-want-you-to-get-a-cut-11638633640?mod=hp_featst_pos3).
- [The new Gemini User Wallet in Brave Rewards lets users seamlessly redeem and move their BAT. (video) (vimeo.com)](https://vimeo.com/595169365), for text only announce, [check this out (brave.com)](https://brave.com/gemini-user-wallet/).
- `I can't claim my BAT!?` Try disabling any VPN/Proxy/SOCKS. In case you're on Android you need SafetyNet to pass, you can try to [bypass it via Magisk (android.gadgethacks.com)](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/magisk-101-fix-safetynet-cts-profile-mismatch-errors-0178047/). If you cannot claim your reward disable your VPN/Proxy and restart (relaunch) your Browser. Keep in mind that toggling VPN, Proxies, Tor, Shadowsocks etc. might results that your account gets flagged automatically by the system, this means you do not see any ads anymore once this is done. You can ask in the forum to remove the flag from your account but if they notice you constantly toggle such systems you might even get banned. The flagging system is in place to avoid fraud and not to censor someone.
