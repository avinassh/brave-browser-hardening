## [Aggressive trolling because Brave uses the word ‚ÄùPrivacy‚Äù](#aggressive-trolling-because-brave-uses-the-word-privacy)

Especially some Firefox people or shall I say loyal fans [trolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll) Brave Browser and their Developer Team since practically day one because of the marketing slogan - ‚Äùprivacy browser‚Äù. This is harsh as well as based because no Browser ever will be perfect in this regard. Privacy is not an on or off switch and needs continuously inspection, maintenance and changes to adopt and respond to new problems. Those smear campaigns come often from uneducated people that are not even developers themselves, such people tend to cherry pick some leaks or open issue tickets and claim the Browser is not as private as advertised to make the Browser look worse than others. This is a pointless effort because you find on every single Browser some open issue tickets, Tor Browser, Firefox, all of them have always some open issue tickets regarding privacy. This is not how FOSS works and this is no measurement instrument as "privacy index". The Brave Team puts a lot of time and research into privacy related problems, same like Firefox and the Tor Browser Project.

Another strategy is to [spread fake forks to smear Brave](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/unbrave-git), even after I reported it to Brave and the Arch Team via Tweet, such disrespectful forks continue to stay online. Not only is this deformation it also exposes how based people are against any competition.

Brave Browser is de facto privacy respecting and does by default more than any other Browser on the market, this is done by including a lot of ideas and privacy respecting changes directly into the Brave Browser. In every other Browser you need to work with extensions or configuration changes to come even remotely close to Brave Browser. I do not see how the troll argumentation holds that Brave fails regarding privacy, it is offering a solid ground with the arguably best default out-of-the-box configuration.

If you goal is to become nearly anonymous then use Tor Browser, the Brave Team clearly communicated this since day one on their website.

## [Brave Referral Story](#brave-referral-story)

- [Brave browser CEO apologizes for automatically adding affiliate links to cryptocurrency URLs](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology).

The whole story got a lot of attention, however it always was misleading and spread to gain clicks. The matter was resolved after 7-8 hours and pushed within 12 hours as commit. The actual update got released within 24 hours. Some users had to wait 48 hours because this is how the distribution system handles and delivers updates to avoid huge pressure on the server or hit GitHub limitations.

> ‚ÄúThat being said, I think there was a lot of misunderstanding of the situation. There was no privacy harm to users, and what was being done is similar to how most, if not all, browsers interact with search engines, to receive referral cash. Using DDG in Firefox, to give one example, tells DDG the query came from Firefox the "FFAB", or, guessing, "Firefox Address Bar"‚Ä¶‚Äù


> ‚Äú‚Ä¶The user was never able to be tracked, the site wasn't able to learn anything additional about you, etc.‚Äù

A fake story with false background information, see [Brave legally threatens Brave fork trying to remove adds.](https://bitgrum.com/2020/09/11/brave-browser-fork-changes-name-after-legal-threats/).

> In April 2019, Dissenter was removed from the Firefox Add-ons website and the Chrome Web Store for violation of their policies that causes the creation of the Dissenter web browser.

## [Story about Braver Fork](#story-about-braver-fork)

The story was mainly about [Trademark](https://trademarks.justia.com/869/51/brave-86951863.html) violation and not about replacing ads, the Team never asked or contacted Brave to ask for permission to begin with. Also you need to do some legal proceeding because GitHub does not take content offline without any court order or trademark confirmation.

## [Contradiction regarding Privacy Communities](#contradiction-regarding-privacy-communities)

Brave contradicts themselves with weird statements regarding supporting privacy related communities or not. This is not positive nor negative, just weird.
