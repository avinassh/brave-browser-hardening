    - Desktop/Mobile Performance: Back-forward cache causes, still some problems so we disable it, same like `#durable-client-hints-cache`. In general we try to avoid any cache, not only because performance and lags but also because fingerprinting reasons. Keep in mind that in general prefetch requests will not follow redirects, not send a Referer header, not send credentials for cross-origin requests, and do not pass through service workers. However, they still can be abused to fingerprint coming from extensions and PWAs.
    - Desktop Privacy: `#enable-webusb-device-detection` enforced to disabled.
    - Desktop Security: `#enable-isolated-sandboxed-iframes` will be enforced to enabled.
    - Desktop/Mobile Privacy: `#edit-context` enforced to disabled.

    - Desktop/Mobile Privacy: `#font-access`
    - Desktop/Mobile Energy:`#throttle-foreground-timers` + `#enable-throttle-display-none-and-visibility-hidden-cross-origin-iframes`

    - News: [DuckDuckGo under fire for the ranking scandal](https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1501922103418769408?t=5Fqaa2-KMZwHRNkYKjCVKA). It is relevant because DDG is - for now - the default choice for most countries, until Brave Search becomes fully stable.
    - Mobile Performance: `#enable-drdc`, + `#canvas-oop-rasterization` and `#enable-gpu-rasterization` do not causing tabs to crash anymore. Debugging on Android remains a PITA because missing DEV-UI extension.
    - Linux Tip: `#enable-skia-renderer` gets rid of Intel iGPU log spam under `brave://gpu/`. You can also enable it on AMD systems without any problem, there are no drawbacks. However this is a Linux specific tip since Windows handles OpenGL differently and there is no skia composition as renderer so Chromium will ignore it anyway.
    - Desktop Performance: Enforce Vulkan via Flag instead of cmdline toggle. On Android it is too unstable and causes some additional problems, such as battery drain as well as graphic glitches. On newer Android versions this is less a problem but on older ones like Android 8+ it causes some issues. This was reported already and it might finally gets fixed in v101.
    - Bugfix Release: [Brave Browser 1.36.112](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/pull/21582/files)

    - News: Android Brave Version 1.35.103+ (alias Chromium 98.0.4758.102+) from Google Play Store now fully supports and works with [U2F](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/7756), this means hardware like Yubikey Security Key through NFC is fully supported. Brave for Android is the only working mobile Browser that fully supports U2F that actually works. Keep in mind that [U2F will soon be deprecated](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deps-rems-95/) and replaced with [WebAuthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn). Chromiums implementation for WebAuthn will support FIDO2 and FIDO keys but not U2F based keys. It only supports FIDO based keys.

    - Changed: Browseraudit.com removed, the [source code](https://github.com/browseraudit/) is from 2015 and is heavily outdated, there is practical no activity anymore.
    - Ad Block: `#brave-adblock-redirect-url`
    - Mobile Security: `#biometric-reauth-password-filling`, this depends on if you use biometric auth or not, keep in mind that we disable all autofills forms in general. The flag is not mentioned below as this is a personal decision and use-case scenario.
    - Mobile PWA: `#messages-for-android-pwa-install`
    - Desktop Usability: `#page-info-about-this-site`

    - Mobile Usability: `#voice-button-in-top-toolbar`, the flag finally works as intended. `#android-picture-in-picture-api`, `#shopping-list`, `darken-websites-checkbox-in-themes-setting`, `#photo-picker-video-support`, `#page-info-about-this-site`, `#messages-for-android-ads-blocked`, `messages-for-android-permission-update`, `#messages-for-android-reader-mode`

    - Info: The guide is so big that I decided to put it on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/CHEF-KOCH/brave-browser-hardening). However, I try to maintain this page as much as I can but things are already so big that one single page is too much for beginners to comprehend, not everyone likes to spend 1+ hour reading all this and the page loading times are also getting slower and slower with each new line and update. Bear Blog is not designed the way I use it.
    - Changed: Lots of new flags added for Android. I try to release some updates tomorrow, the thing with Android and fragmentation is pretty huge. For example there are lots of Browser crashes when enabling specific flags especially on older Android versions. Browser mobile versions were always problematically due to the fact that its pretty rough to test all variables, we have different OS builds, different use-cases, e.g. MicroG users, AOSP users, LOS users etc. this can influence performance as well as how things are actually responding in the real-world. Some flags work perfectly fine, others are Android P+ only specific, finding out what flags makes most sense and provide an actual benefit is pretty hard and time intensive.
- 04.03.2022
    - Desktop/Usability: `History Journeys`, `History Journeys Omnibox Action` and `Page info history` enabled which makes it easier to work with search and tab history. The journeys are not collected in private browser mode and nothing is submitted. I see it as useful to use those flags since it makes it easier to search and use history without opening dozens of new tabs.
    - Desktop/Mobile Performance: Enable `#restrict-websockets-pool` by default, which limits the connections to 6 which is enough for most websites. There are some intense websites that possible require more but I never found some websites who entirely break because of this. This also has a security benefit and the reason why I want to enforce it.
- 03.03.2022
    - Fixed: Starting with Chrome 99.0.4844.51+ you can again delete default search engine providers, this was actually by design, the story about this is that people started to remove all entries and had no visible option to restore the default list. The workaround to mess with profile settings and configuration files often ended up with profile corruptions and it was very hard foe beginners to deal with it. In the future Chrome will get an visible option and button to restore the default list.

    - Crash: [#enable-fenced-frames](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1123606) with DOM enabled causes Browser crashes whenever you close a tab, on Android versions prior 9. A workaround is to put it on only `Enabled`, this is an OS specific limitation with older Android versions.

    - [CSS-Exfil-Protection](https://github.com/mlgualtieri/CSS-Exfil-Protection) will be declared obsolete with Chromium 102+.
    - The attack on uBlock is fixed, as [per discussion](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/20043). It will be integrated in the next stable bugfix release. Rust fixed it with v0.4.2+.
- 08.12.2021

    - Desktop Privacy: `#extensions-menu-access-control`added, upcoming in the next stave version.
    - Desktop/Mobile: `#brave-news` is a new flag which controls if you can entirely enable or disable Brave News, even on Android. This is not security or privacy relevant. Upcoming in the next stable version.
    - Desktop/Mobile: `#brave-ads-allowed-to-fallback-to-custom-push-notification-ads` is an individual flag which normally does not need to enabled. In the future this flag will become redundant and self-regulated.
    - Desktop/Mobile Ad-Block: `#brave-adblock-cookie-list-default` makes manually enabling `Easylist-Cookie List - Filter Obtrusive Cookie Notices` obsolete, I prefer the flag because it is more reliable and overrides AdBlock settings. I put it under performance because I do not intend to create a section for just ad-blocking related flags, we already have below an explainer how to utilize Braves AdBlock mechanism the right way. The flag gets introduced for everyone in the upcoming stable release.

    - `Mobile PWA` section added, optional.
    - `Desktop PWA` section added, same like the scrolling section this is optional.
    - Brave search FAQ updated: New privacy concerns added.
    - The `chrome://flags#freeze-user-agent` flag was renamed to `chrome://flags/#reduce-user-agent` in Chrome 93+ and the values were updated to align with the plan below (also testable via `--enable-features=ReduceUserAgent`). We enforce the flag.

    - No one noticed it for months but it was not `brave://flags#` how listed Brave flags started, it actually is `brave://flags/#`. Now flags working if you copy the URL and open it in another tap. Opening them via right-click and open in new tab will automatically blocked, you need to copy the link and open it in another tab, then it jumps to the flag and highlights it, however I replaced it now with `chrome://` to make it compatible with other chromium based browsers. Brave internal uses chrome anyway.
- 31.10.2021
    - Why does fingerprinting matters less than you think added.
    - Utilizing Brave Ad Block, the right-way section added.
- 30.10.2021
    - Improved Brave RAM section.
    - Added Tabs Session Manager under considerable essential extensions. The reason is that the extension is suggested in AMO as well as in Google Store, it is FOSS + has independent Sync option + the options page renders nicely even on tablets.
    - Added JS-Restrictor extension settings. This is optional.
    - Removed since 95+ Desktop: `#dns-httpssvc`, `#omnibox-default-typed-navigations-to-https`, `#brave-first-party-ephemeral-storage`, `enable-unsafe-webgpu-service`, `#quiet-notification-prompts` got implemented into the settings UI, `#privacy-sandbox-settings`, `#safety-check-chrome-cleaner-child`

    - End-of-Life: `#https-only-mode-setting` does not needs to be enforced anymore starting with Chrome 96+. This listed flag will be changed once Brave comes with 96+ stable. `#brave-dark-mode-block` gets removed as flag on Desktop at some point, there is no specific date given, Brave Shields settings will handle it if you set it to aggressive (which we do, see below).
    - Outdated with Chrome 95+ Desktop: `#brave-speedreader` now has his own Menu Point under Settings, therefore we do not need any flag anymore. `#brave-decentralized-dns` removed as suggestion, the option under Settings now fully works, so we do not need to list the flag. `#brave-adblock-cname-uncloaking` is not anymore needed to be enforced, this depends starting with 95.x on the Shields settings, on mobile it still needs to be enforced until 96.x.
    - Added new section for [Browser Desktop Defaults](https://chef-koch.bearblog.dev/brave-browser-hardening-by-chef-koch/#changes-we-enforce-as-defaults-on-shields-and-permissions-on-desktop) with pictures.

- 14.10.2021
    - Fix Internal linking for headings.

We do not need to touch `#enable-autofill-account-wallet-storage` because we use [third-party password manager for passwords](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/dont-let-web-browsers-save-passwords) and we disabled auto fill entirely for password fields.

	- Mention `Privacytests.org`, which provides an overview chart, it is as time of writing this still beta.
	- Desktop/Mobile Security: `#u2f-security-key-api` disabled - [Chrome 95 does not introduce any GUI improvements](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/27/whats-new-in-chrome-95-now-rolling-out-to-the-beta-channel-apk-download/).
- 08.10.2021
    - Desktop/Mobile Security: [#https-only-mode-setting enforced](https://beebom.com/how-enable-https-only-mode-chrome-firefox-edge-safari/). This makes [Brave Shields HTTPS mode obsolete](https://twitter.com/CKsTechNews/status/1446457584052056066). After you enabled the mentioned option you must go to the Settings page and enable the HTTPS first mode manually, it is not enough to just toggle the flag and restart Brave Browser.
